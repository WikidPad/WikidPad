++ Link Title

A link title is the part inside of a bracketed URL or wiki word link after the vertical bar '|' (if present) up to the closing bracket. It contains the text and/or image that should be shown in HTML preview or export instead of the link. You can click then on this content to go to the linked URL or wiki word.

A title can contain simple formatting (bold, italics) and image URLs (see [UrlLinking#++ Images]).

Examples (also look at it in preview mode):

[UrlLinking]  (no title, shows default text)

[UrlLinking|a title to replace the default]

[https://somewheresecure.com|Some *text* and _an image_ rel://files/testimg.gif>r40% to click on]


+++ Little caveat: image URLs with spaces

URLs in brackets are allowed to contain spaces which are automatically replaced by the appropriate escape code '%20' before the link is followed. This rule only apply to the actual link URL (before '|'). To use spaced image URLs in a title you must bracket them separately, e.g.

[https://somewheresecure.com|[rel://files/spaced testimg.gif]]
