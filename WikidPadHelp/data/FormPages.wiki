++ Form Pages

Especially in conjunction with [Templates], you might have pages where only a few special fields should be filled in, like a form.

For this you can place the attribute \[pagetype: form] on a page.

If such a page is opened (or created automatically from a template with this attribute) the editor automatically selects the first &&i tag.

These tags mark the positions, where data should be entered. You can now just type in text which overwrites the tag. The Tab key moves to the next &&i tag.


Example:

Create a template with the attribute on it: [SystemInfoTemplate]

Register it as template for this page: [template: SystemInfoTemplate]


Set a link to a non-existing page and go to it to fill in data:

MySystemInfo


This example is of practical use because the questions on the page should be answered (among others) when sending a bug report.
