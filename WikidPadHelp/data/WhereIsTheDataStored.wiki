++ Where Is The Data Stored


This depends on the used database type:

+++ Original Gadfly
The data for your wiki is stored in plain text under the data
directory of the directory your Wiki config is stored in. There is
one file per wiki word. The .grl and .gdf files are the database
files used to index your wiki words efficiently.

This type is slow but portable across different platforms because it
doesn't need any external binaries.



+++ Compact Sqlite (aka WikidPadCompact)
The data is stored in a single file named "wiki.sli" under the data
directory of the directory your Wiki config is stored in. This
database file is created by the Sqlite database engine and contains
the content of all wiki pages as well as the cache information for
fast handling of your wiki.

Advantages of this type are its speed and efficient usage of hard disk
space. On the other hand single pages can't be edited with a text
editor or searched by a desktop search engine (like Google Desktop).



+++ Original Sqlite
The data for your wiki is stored in plain text under the data
directory of the directory your Wiki config is stored in. There is one
file per wiki word. The database to index the wiki is stored in the
file "wikiovw.sli".

This type provides one file per page (as "Original Gadfly") which can
be edited or searched by external programs and is nearly as fast as
"Compact Sqlite".
