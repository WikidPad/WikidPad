++ Folding

Folding is a well known technique in programming editors, but it is also useful for large structured pages in WikidPad.

Folding means to hide or show a logical group of text lines when clicking on a particular sign in the editor (usually a plus or minus sign). In WikidPad this logical grouping is done by the headings.

First, to show the folding symbol use "Show folding" in the "Tabs" menu. You will see an additional margin on the left of the editor window and a minus sign to the left of each heading (meaning "unfolded").

If you now click on one of the signs, all normal text below it until the next heading with same or higher level (+ is higher than ++ is higher than +++ and so on) is hidden and the minus becomes a plus (meaning folded). A second click reverts the situation. Instead of clicking you can also select "toggle current folding" in the "Tabs" menu.

The functions "Unfold All" and "Fold All" in the "Tabs" menu (un-)fold all parts in the current text editor.
