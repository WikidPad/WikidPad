++ Wiki Home
Go to the wiki root word (the word with the same name as the whole wiki).

++ Upward
If current tab shows a [Subpage] this opens the superpage, e.g. from [SearchingTheWiki/BooleanRegex] it moves to [SearchingTheWiki].

++ Go to Page
Opens dialog to open a particular page. This dialog also allows to open or delete multiple pages. If you enter a non-existing page name you can also create a new page there.

After entering a few characters, the list only shows page names which start with these characters and after that names which contain the characters. The names inside of these two groups can be ordered either alphabetically or by the time of last visit of this page, so most recently used pages are placed near the top of the list.

++ Go to Parent
Shows a list of parents for the current wiki word and allows to go to one of it.

++ List Children
Same as "Go to Parent" for children of current page.

++ List Parentless Pages
List of all parentless nodes (independent of current wiki word).

++ Up History

++ Down History

++ Go to Bookmark
