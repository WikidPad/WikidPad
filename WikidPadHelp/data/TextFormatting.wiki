++ Text Formatting

As you type you can enter formatting commands in plain text.

*bold*
_italic_
+ Heading1
++ Heading2
+++ Heading3
++++ Heading4

When you type in a really really really really really really really really really really really really
long line you can tell wikidPad to rewrap it for you by pressing Ctrl-W. Try it on this line.

You can even change the wrap position by adding a wrap attribute to your document.
[wrap: 20]
Changes the wrapping on this page to 20.

[global.wrap: 70]
changes the global wrap position to 70.

+++ Escaping Formatting

++++ Escaping markup
To create a section of text with no formatting, wrap that section 
in a "\<< >>" block. Example:

escape formatting

<<
*This should be bold* ThisShouldBeALink
>> 

with formatting

You can also use this on a single line <<like here>>. Inside the markup no newline is allowed.

*This should be bold* ThisShouldBeALink

Before and after the begin and end tags only whitespaces are allowed on the same line, so a << in the text does not prevent ALink from being highlighted.

++++ Preformatted blocks

You can use \<<\pre and >> to enclose blocks which have no special formatting (wiki words, italics) as the default escaping blocks but are shown in HTML as monospaced blocks and have exactly the same formatting as written in the source text.

This is helpful especially for programming source code.

Example:
<<pre
                      ^
                     / \
                    /   \
                   /_____\
                  (       )
                  |       |
                  |       |
                  |       |
                  |       |
                  L_______j
>>


++++ Hidden markup

Hidden markups are not published to HTML or shown in preview but are otherwise fully processed by WikidPad so you can enclose comments in it as well as attributes or todos which show up in tree.

A hidden markup is written as \<<\hide >> either on a single line (no newline in it) or as a block like the escaping markup.

<<hide
You only see this in editor
>>

++++ HTML as is
To send HTML content without any modifications by WikidPad to HTML preview/export enclose it in << <body></body> >> tags.

<body>
This
would
be placed 

on multiple 

lines without the body tag
</body>

++++ Escaping characters
To escape single characters, prepend them with a backslash. These characters are then interpreted as normal text, the backslash is suppressed in HTML preview and export. If you want to really write a backslash, write two of them: \\.

With this, you can write \[brackets] or \*asterisks\* which are not seen as formatting commands by \WikidPad.


+++ Tables

See [TableFormatting]


anchor: html
+++ HTML tags and entities
You can also use <b>HTML tags</b> and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entities in WikidPad. Use preview to show the effect of them.
