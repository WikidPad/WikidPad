++ Wiki Export

You can export your wiki as a single html page, a set of html
pages, one wiki word page at a time, or in [Multipage text format].

You can select a few predefined operations from the "Wiki" menu:

Publish as HTML / Wiki As Single Html Page
Publish as HTML / Wiki As Set of Html Pages
Publish as HTML / Current Wiki Word As Html Page


Or you can use Publish as HTML / Other Export to show a dialog to choose other settings:

*What to export*
Choose if you want to export current page only, the current page and all sub-pages (children, grandchildren...), the whole wiki or use "Custom..." to open the [SearchingTheWiki#To search all pages: Full search|full search].

*Compatible filenames*
Uses ASCII-only filenames for exported files so that they can be transferred to other filesystems without compatibility issues. On Windows XP and Server 2003 the AppLocale utility (see http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/tools/apploc.mspx ) might also help on export problems.

*Export to*
You can export a single HTML page, one HTML page for each wiki page, a [Multipage text format] file or a set of .wiki files (mainly interesting for Compact version to migrate to original).

*Destination file/directory*
Here you can set where the exported file(s) should be stored. If file or directory is needed depends on the type given in "Export to". For XML and multipage text it is a single file, for other types it is a directory (because multiple files must be written).


When exporting as HTML all files in the file storage which are referenced by a relative URL (URL beginning with "rel://") in the exported pages are copied to a "files" directory in the destination directory. This does also apply to files in subdirectories of the "files" directory.


*Saved exports*
You can store your current export settings and retrieve them later to do the same export job repeatedly.

*Save Export*
Asks for a name for the current settings and saves it.

*Delete Export(s)*
Deletes one or more selected export(s) after confirmation.

*Load Export*
Loads export which is currently selected in list. Your previous settings made in the dialog are overwritten.

*Load and Run Export*
Same as first hitting "Load Export" then "OK" to start the export. Double-clicking on a saved export in the list does the same.



+++ Additional options for HTML exports
For the HTML exports you can choose if you want to:
    * export URLs to images as \<img> tags or as normal links
    * create a table of contents either as a tree or as a list.
      For a single HTML page, the TOC is at the beginning of the
      page, for a set of HTML pages, it is a separate
      "index.html" file.
      Using "As tree" is recommended when exporting the whole or
      nearly the whole wiki, "As list" is better for small subsets
      of a wiki as the tree option gives weird results here.
    
The defaults for these options can be set in the options dialog.


+++ Additional options for .wiki file exports
For the .wiki export you can choose if the files should have system encoding or UTF-8 with or without BOM (byte-order mark). The import function of Compact can't recognize UTF-8 without BOM correctly.


+++ Additional options for multipage text format

*Version*
Choose which version the file should have. If you use version 1 it can be read only by WikidPad 1.9beta6 and later. Version 0 can also be read by earlier versions but looses information.

*Write version data of pages*
Export also previous versions of the wiki pages you export. Only available for format version 1 and later.

*Write wiki func. pages*
Export also wiki-bound functional pages in the file. Only available for format version 1 and later.

*Write saved searches*
Export also saved searches in the file. Only available for format version 1 and later.


+++ Continuous export

In menu "Extra" you can also choose "Continuous Export" which allows to start an export operation which is repeated automatically each time a page previously designated for export is modified.

The dialog for continuous export is the same as for normal export, but some export types are missing as currently only the HTML export types support continuous export. Also some of the saved exports are hidden if they refer to exports not supported by continuous export.

After you made your choices what and where to export and pressed "OK", WikidPad first makes an initial normal export. After that every change to a page is reflected in the export *after the page was saved to database* (manually or by auto-save).

If you choose the menu item "Continuous Export" again (which has now a checkmark), the continuous export function is switched off again. It is also automatically deactivated if WikidPad is closed or another wiki is opened in the same window.

A few drawbacks to mention:

    1. Changes on a page that affect other pages (e.g. adding/removing attribute "\[global.camelCaseWordsEnabled: false]") will not change the already exported pages until they are re-exported.
    2. The set of pages to export will be static under some circumstances. Especially if you start auto-export for all children of one or more pages, it will only export pages which were children when auto-export started regardless if new children are added later.
    3. If you export as a single HTML file, the whole HTML file must be recreated on each change so it is only recommended if you export a few small pages.
    4. If temporary (volatile) files must be created (e.g. generated from MimeTeX or GraphViz) there may be created new ones again and again on each change of a page filling up the "volatile" directory. Therefore it is recommended to make a final non-continuous export to clean up the garbage.
    5. HTML files may contain dead links to pages not exported (because they may be exported later). This is another reason to finally make a non-continuous export.
