Aug. 26, 2008 (1.9beta17, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 145)

    * When exporting, files in the file storage
      ("files" directory) which are referenced on exported pages
      are copied to export destination "files" folder.
      See FileStorage#+++# On# HTML# export
    * When exporting, generated files (by MimeTeX, GraphViz, ...)
      are put to subfolder "volatile" which is deleted each time

      See UrlLinking#++# URL# Appendix
