official parser

Dec. 05, 2010 (2.1beta09)

Creators of derived WikidPad parsers should merge changes from
official parser

    * Autocompletion now also suggests builtin attributes
    * Command line options to run a saved export profile either once
      or as continuous export.
      See [CommandLineSupport#*--export-saved <name of saved export>*]

    * Hungarian translation of help wiki (separate download)

    * Small change in logic to find a template: If a newly created
      page has multiple parents it will be created from a template
      if there are no contradictory "template" attributes in the
      parents but at least one "template" attribute exists.

Sep. 25, 2010 (2.1beta07)

    * "WikidPadParser.py" modified. If you have your own version
      you must update it!

    * Some changes to better support of subpages (pages with
      slashes to create some kind of path). If you do not use
      them you shouldn't notice a difference.
    * See [Subpages#+++ Wiki links versus wiki page names]:
        * "alias" and "template" attributes now process wiki links
          instead of wiki page names
        * Replace text by wikiword dialog now processes wiki links
          instead of wiki page names
        * Auto-completion updated

    * If an attribute value in "Views" subtree is empty it is
      replaced by its children (the wiki pages containing the
      attribute)

    * Bug fixed: Linux: Problem when opening a wiki where not
      the left-most tab was selected last
    * Bug fixed: Menu item "Search and Replace" remained gray

      in single process mode.
      See [OptionsDialog#*Warn about other processes*]
    * Option "coldir down" in appendix of "rel" insertions to sort
      found wiki words downwards in columns instead of rightwards.

    * Wiki properties dialog now also shows configuration path and
      if wiki is read-only explains why

    * Small problems with non-ascii paths fixed



Jul. 27, 2010 (2.1beta05)

      file storage (instead of copying) and to be asked every time
      what to do. See [OptionsDialog#*Dropping files*]
    * Option to define what to insert before, after and between file
      links when dropping files.
      See [OptionsDialog#+++++ File dropping]

      See [SpellChecking#++ Spell check while type]
    * Commandline options to start tabs in preview mode and to
      prevent list of recent opened wikis from updating.

      for i18n



Jul. 04, 2010 (2.1alpha04)

      file format is supported now.
      See [WikiExport#+++ Additional options for multipage text format]
    * Fine grained import control of multipage text files: Rename on
      name collision, decide which data to import, decide if
      versioning data should be imported for each wiki page.
      See [WikiImport#+++ Additional options for multipage text format]
    * Simple log rotation for error log to keep maximum disc space
      needed for log at about 1 MByte. If log is over 512 KBytes on
      WikidPad startup, it is renamed to "WikidPad_Error_bak.log"
      (if this file existed already, it is deleted).

    * Bug fixed: Errors due to bad cache when using different
      versions side-by-side with non-English UI language

      file names should be used for wiki page files (default is on
      for Mac OS, see [OptionsDialog#*Page file names ASCII only*])
    * Option to slow down background tree update (to reduce
      response delay of WikidPad).

    * Support for processing right-clicks on toolbar icons from

    * New database format! It is recommended to make a backup before
      updating and run "Maintenance"->"Update cache" after that

      "Open Wiki Word" dialog allows now to sort by newest or oldest
      visit time. See [Menu Navigate#++ Go to Page]

      now behaves exactly as the "attr:" prefix.

      a similar way as attributes. If you have your own parser, update

      interference with WikidPad key bindings
