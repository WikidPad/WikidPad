+ Todo Items

In WikidPad "todo", "done", "action", "track", "issue", "question" and
"project" are special keywords that enable you to track important
items under the "View" menu in the tree.

todo: I have to do this.
done: I have done this.
action: I have action items
track: I am tracking this
issue: I am tracking this
question: This is a question
project: This is my project

Now open the views node in the tree on the left to see how these todo
items have been added.  For example, open "Views/question" and you will
see a node named "This is a question."

Unwanted todo items like e.g.:

    Interesting CD track: loud music

can be escaped:

    Interesting CD \track: loud music


A todo item ends either with a newline or with a vertical bar |. If you want to insert a bar into the item, you can escape it with a backslash.

Example: todo: This item ends here| This isn't part of the item.
todo: This ends \| not.

Look in the "Views" subtree to see the todo entries.


These items supports nested sub-categories also, for example:

todo.system.bugs.urgent: There is a bug in the system

Will create a "system" node in the tree under "Views/todo", which has a "bugs" subnode which has a "urgent" subnode...
