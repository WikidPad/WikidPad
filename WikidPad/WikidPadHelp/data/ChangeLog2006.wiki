    * "noerror" appendix for insertions for external graphical apps
      (except MimeTeX) to ignore warning/error messages.
      See ExternalGraphicalApplications.
    * For Windows: Option to use Internet Explorer or

Nov. 24, 2006 (1.8beta5, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 99)

    * Changed insertion syntax where value or appendices can
      be quoted to include arbitrary characters. See [Insertions].
    * Plugins for accessing MimeTeX, Ploticus and GraphViz
      applications via Insertions.

    * Tags to mark text as suppressed (<< >>) are no longer shown
      in HTML preview/export
    * "Wiki Info" dialog to show some basic information about the

      always overwritten on updating.

    * Internal: Plugin type "InsertionByKey" created which registers
      special insertion keys to be handled by a plugin
    * Internal: Plugin type "Options" created which allows to
      register additional options (to be saved in config files) and

Oct. 30, 2006 (1.8beta4, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 96)

    * Menu items and toolbar icons for zoom in/out also work for
      preview now.
    * Better page search. Search starts at cursor position or
      optional at beginning. Before wrapping search from page end
      to beginning, user is asked.
    * Bug fixed: Showing (more precisely searching) of words in
      subcategories of todos in tree did not work.

      attributes in tree. See OptionsDialog#*Sort# order*
    * The order how wiki pages are ordered when printing or
      exporting the whole wiki or a subtree to a single HTML page
      is (hopefully) more logical. It is the same as the new
      "As Tree" order used in PageListDialog#"As# Tree" .
    * Option to generate a table of contents in tree or list form
      for HTML exports, see WikiExport#*Additional# options* ,
      [Options HTML preview_export]#*Table# of# contents*

    * Bug fixed: Pages were shown as parentless even if an alias
      of the page had a parent
    * Bug fixed: Opening a particular page on startup by mentioning
      the .wiki file on commandline did not work
    * Bug fixed: Special URLs containing $ couldn't be activated
      (further fixes may be necessary)

      and indented.



Sep. 30, 2006 (1.8beta2, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 92)

    * Support for insertion of pages, relations (parents, children,

      first time.
    * Fixed bug: Opening a wiki page file instead of
      wiki configuration file failed.



Aug. 30, 2006 (1.8beta1, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 89)

Changes:
    * New database format! After updating a wiki it won't be
      readable anymore for older versions of WikidPad.
    * Updating of wiki databases to new versions is now done only
      after asking user.
    * New position for configuration files on Windows inside
      "Application Data\WikidPad" directory. You might have to move
      "WikidPad.config" file and ".WikidPadGlobals" directory from
      "Application Data" to the new location if updating from
      a previous version. Name of "Application Data" directory
      depends on OS language.
    
    * Cursor and scroll position are now saved between sessions.
    * Possibility to set size and alignment for image URLs.
      See UrlLinking#++# URL# Appendix
    * Functional pages for "camelcase blacklist". Words on this
      list are not shown as wiki links. See WordLinking
    * Option to automatically remove bullets and numbers which
      stand "lonely" on a line by pressing enter.
      See BulletedLists
    
    * Menu functions "Show Tree Control", "Show Toolbar" and
      "Stay on Top" moved to "View" menu
    * Preview now shows indented paragraphs correctly (or,
      at least, better)
    
    * Bug fixed: Wiki word aliases not shown as links on
      HTML export.
    * Bug fixed: Wrong URL creation mode when releasing/pressing
      SHIFT or CTRL during drag&drop operation.
    * Better handling of non Western-European languages on
      Win 98/ME



Aug. 05, 2006 (1.7beta8, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 85)

Changes:
    * Official support for multiple windows with same wiki in
      them, but only in the same process (therefore necessarily
      on the same machine and by the same user), you can use
      e.g. menu "View"->"Clone Window" for that. This function
      is not meant as collaborative multi-user support. 
    * Option to handle new WikidPad windows by a single process
      (recommended if you want to open the same wiki in multiple
      windows).
      See OptionsDialog#*Single# process# per# user*

    * Better error handling if file access drops (e.g. accessing
      wiki db over a network). See WikiMaintenance#++# Reconnect

    * Option to minimize wiki if close button on frame is pressed.
      See OptionsDialog#*Minimize# on# close# button*



Jul. 10, 2006 (1.7beta7, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 83)

Changes:
    * "Fast search" text field in toolbar. See SearchingTheWiki

    * Error log file is now written in the same directory where
      configuration file "WikidPad.config" is, it has a new name
      ("WikidPad_Error.log" instead of "WikidPad.exe.log") and
      writes timestamps and version number for each new session
      where an error occurred.
    * More verbose messages/exceptions when executing
      scripts/evaluating expressions.

    * Optical changes in extension "referrals.py" (thanks to
      schnullibullihulli).
    * Menus slightly reorganized, some menu items are at other
      places and/or have another name.
    * Wiki specific option to set page title prefix
      (normally "++") for new wiki pages. This allows to freely
      choose the heading level.
      See OptionsDialog#*New# page# title# prefix*
    * Possibility to add (absolute) URL with file dialog (menu
      "Editor" -> "Add file URL"). 
    * Fixed exporter bugs: No newline after "Parents: ..." start
      line in HTML export, unnecessary newline after each item
      in bulleted/numbered list.
    * Bug fixed: "compact_sqlite" db backend lost creation date.

    * Help wiki is opened now in the same process so file suffix
      .wiki needs no longer to be associated with WikidPad to
      show help.
    * Internal: Different handling of clipboard copy which may
      fix a bug (or not).
    * Internal: Extension files are now loaded with universal
      newline support, so newline conversion for Linux shouldn't
      be necessary anymore.
    * Windows binary installer now supports installation for
      current user only (on NT-based systems) or for all users
      (if installing as administrator, you are asked how to
      install).



Jun. 02, 2006 (1.7beta6, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 80)

Changes:
    * Support for an additional "Views" tree which can be put at any
      side of main tree, also option to put main tree at any side of
      editor (layout change during session has bugs).
      See OptionsDialog#*Position# main# tree* .
    * Clipboard catcher: New option to insert at cursor.
      See ClipboardCatcher.
    * Option for showing line numbers in editor
    * If ++ title of page was unmodified since page creation, it is
      changed on page rename accordingly.
      See RenamingWikiWords#*Title# auto-rename*
    * Fixed bug: Upper case non-ascii letters were not found when
      opening a wiki word (e.g. "ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°" didn't find ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°ve).
    * HTML-tag \<pre> is now handled much better.
    * Changed controls in spell check dialog to circumvent problems
      with some languages on Win 98/ME
    
    * Fixed bug: No preview if newly created page wasn't saved first.
    * Fixed bug: No preview if page contains plain text only.
    * Fixed bug: WikidPad didn't work if date pattern for
      creation/modification date in status line created/contained
      non-ascii characters.
    * Fixed bug: double-escaped relative URLs (could be seen e.g. if
      path has spaces)
    * Fixed bug: Copying text to ScratchPad didn't work if copying
      from ScratchPad
    
    * Internal: "C:\Windows" is no longer used as configuration
      directory if all other possibilities fail.



May 08, 2006 (1.7beta5, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 77)

Changes:

    * Clipboard catcher (Windows only): Every piece of text added to
      the clipboard is also appended to a wiki page if the clipboard
      catcher is active. There is also an option to set some suffix
      after each caught piece of text from clipboard (by default, a
      newline is added). See ClipboardCatcher.
    * File storage introduced: Copy files into a subdirectory of the
      wiki within WikidPad. See FileStorage.

    * Options to choose text colors for editor. See
      OptionsDialog#*Plain# text# color* and following.
    * Control background and text color of HTML export (and partially
      for preview) by attributes (for wiki or page) or by options for
      the whole application.
      See [Options HTML preview_export]#+++# HTML# page# settings

    * If a wiki word node is clicked which is subnode of an attribute
      node, the particular attribute is selected as it worked already
      for todo items.

    * New menu item to hide/show toolbar.
    * New menu item to keep window always on top.
    * New options dialog consisting of multiple pages.
    
    * Simpler function for some standard dialogs for scripts.
      See [ApiDocs]#stdDialog

    * Changed method to find configuration directory, more suitable
      for WikidPad on USB-stick and more reliable. See WikidPadOnUSB
      and ApplicationConfigurationFiles.


Bugs fixed:

    * Todo item part shows up twice in tree with same content if part
      is also right side of a todo entry. Now shows up only once.
    * Wrong cursor position after using bold or italic from
      menu/toolbar
    * "Show referring Wikis" in the "Plugins" menu didn't work
    * Exception when refreshing tree while "saved searches" node is
      expanded
    * Exception when trying to paste something non-textual from
      clipboard
    * Workaround for wxPython bug: Crash when showing colored menu
      items on Win 98/Me



Apr. 21, 2006 (1.7beta4, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 74)

Changes:

    * One or more of the characters .,;:!? can directly follow
      an URL and aren't counted as part of it. If you need such
      a character as last one in an URL, enclose the URL in brackets.
    * Attribute names can consist of all alphanumeric
      (unicode definition) characters.
    * Support for zoom in preview (with Ctrl-+, Ctrl-- and
      Ctrl-Mousewheel).
    * Better formatting of titles of newly created wiki pages
      (e.g. wikiword "URLViewer" now leads to title "++ URL Viewer"
      instead of "++ URLV iewer"

    * Bug fixed: Tree always visible on WikidPad start, even if
      made invisible before previous termination.
    * Bug fixed: Creation of new wikis didn't work
    * Bug fixed: Searches not saveable, saved searches not usable
    * Bug "reduced": Scroll position of page in editor not remembered
      properly. The fix may lead to some visible jumps: sometimes
      you will see the beginning of page for a short time before
      it jumps to the stored position. Moreover, even with the
      fix the stored position may be imprecise sometimes.



Apr. 16, 2006 (1.7beta3, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 73)

Changes:

    * Better alias support. E.g. pages linking to an alias of
      WikiWord are now listed as parents of this word.
    * Support for relative URLS with rel: protocol, see [UrlLinking]
    
    * Initial support for checking special attributes for validity
      (currently only "alias", "icon", "color", "bold") with an
      own "Log Window" for error messages, see [WikiDocumentAttributes].
    
    * Support for spell checking, see [SpellChecking].
    * Todo items can now be terminated with newline or |
    * On multiple attributes of same name on one page (e.g.
      multiple "icon" attributes) the last one is now preferred
      instead of the first one.
    
    * Bug fixed: Cursor position on a page is now stored for
      each page even if page is not modified and saved
    * Scroll position of editor is now stored (during session) as
      cursor position already is.
    * Scroll policy of editor modified to better handling
    
    * Bug fixed: Command line export didn't work because of wrong
      default additional options
    * Bug fixed: Gaps between paragraphs in editor when using some
      fonts (e.g. Verdana) and asynchronous highlighting.
    * Bug fixed: Tree not shown if set invisible and then made
      visible by dragging splitter sash.



Mar. 24, 2006 (1.7beta2, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 70)

Changes:

      See ([WikiExport], [WikiImport], [Multipage text format])    

    * Tree node context menu allows now also choice of color and
      icon of a node as well as appending or prepending of 
      wiki words to a page.
    * Options to switch off automatic bullet/numbering creation
      and auto-indent (see [BulletedLists])

    * Introduced <\<pre >>  block to create preformatted,
      monospaced text
    * Todo items (e.g. "\todo:", "\track:") can start after
      arbitrary text now, not only at the beginning of a line.
      This is currently experimental! It might be changed back
      if user have problems with this (see [TodoItems]).

    * Display of modification and creation date of page in status
      line (customizable date format, see [OptionsDialog])
    * Support for changing of file suffix of page files in the
      config file (not part of options GUI) (see [ChangeFileSuffix])
    * Uses now also environment variable "USERPROFILE" to find
      configuration directory

    * Bug fixed: page-wide "Replace All" could run in an endless
      loop (e.g. when replacing "e" by "ee").



Mar. 09, 2006 (1.7beta1, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 63)

*Warning*: This version has a new database format for
"Compact Sqlite" databases. It is converted automatically
when opening a wiki the first time. Making a backup beforehand
is therefore recommended!

Changes:
    * Introduced new db backend "Original Sqlite".
      See [WhereIsTheDataStored] and [MigrationBetweenDbTypes].
    * For "Set Date Format" dialog last 10 entries are remembered

      behavior of the editor for form-like pages. (see [FormPages])

    * Support for global.child_sort_order attribute.
    * Support for \[child_sort_order: natural] (but not really
      stable). See [WikiDocumentAttributes].
    * Presentation attributes (bold, color, icon) in todo entries
      used to format the entry in tree instead of the page.
    * See [WikiDocumentAttributes].

    * When trying to run a script, but script security doesn't
      allow to run scripts, a message box appears to explain.


Fixed bugs:
    * No titled URLs/wiki words in tables
    * Invalid HTML anchors created
    * Exporting of raw .wiki files didn't work for
      "Original Gadfly" databases

      database update/rebuild.
    * Gadfly database backend: Rebuild does no more loose
      creation and modification date of a page.


Fixed bugs:
    * Crash on non-ascii characters in path to wiki database

Feb. 09, 2006 (1.6beta3, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 57)

Changes:
    * 'global.import_scripts' property introduced (see
      [InlinePythonEval]) 
    * Security option to control if scripts should be executed
      and (global.)import_scripts property should be respected
      (see [InlinePythonEval]) 

    * 'template' property introduced to use content of one page
      as template for children of another page. (see

      'work', "work.somewhere", "work.somewhere.else" ...
      properties, except there is e.g. a
      'global.work.somewhere.else.color' property. This works for
      'color', 'icon' and 'bold' properties which control the
      presentation of the tree nodes (see [WikiDocumentAttributes]).

    * Differential user_extensions: A file in "user_extensions"
      now only needs to contain the  definitions which are
      different compared to the file in "extensions"

    * In configuration directory, a directory ".WikidPadGlobals"
      will be created if not existing
    * In ".WikidPadGlobals" a file "[TextBlocks].wiki" will be
      created if not existing. This file describes content of
      the "Editor"->"Text blocks" submenu and can be customized
      (see [TextBlocks]).

    * Bug with renaming in "compact_sqlite" database fixed



Jan. 25, 2006 (1.6beta2, repository revision in "mbutscher" branch: 55)
