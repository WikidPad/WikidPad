++ Footnotes

Footnotes are numbers enclosed in brackets, e.g. [42].

As this might also be a valid wiki word you have an option to let interpret footnotes just as wiki words. See OptionsDialog#*Footnotes# as# wiki# words*

The following only applies if this option is *not* set for the current wiki:


If the same footnote (footnote with same number) appears multiple times on a page, the last appearance is interpreted as "anchor", all former are interpreted as links to this anchor.

In editor mode this means that double clicking or otherwise activating a footnote brings the cursor to the last occurrence of it on the page.

In preview, all but the last footnote are shown as links which lead to the last one.

You can try it with the [42] here or above. They all lead to the following anchor footnote:


[42] Here you can write something intelligent.


As always you can escape the footnote with a backslash: \[42].
