++ Change Log 2004

Dec. 13, 2004

    1. Added support for export:false] attribute.  Setting this attribute
       to false will cause it to not be included in exports.
    2. Fixed issue with international characters in [Not Camel Case] links
       (thanks to Gilles Lenfant).
    3. [Not Camel Case] links also now autocomplete properly.

Oct. 11, 2004

    1. Added support for sub-tree export.
    2. Exports now (attempt) to indent indented text using \<blockquote>.
    3. Python runtime updated.
    4. I attempted to update to the latest wxWindows and things didn't go
       well. Ended up reverting back.
    5. Additional minor fixes.

    1. Added child_sort_order attribute support.  A parent node can set
       child_sort_order to "ascending", "descending", or "unsorted" to control
       the order of the child nodes in the tree.
       
       [child_sort_order: unsorted]
       
    2. User can now place their extensions in "user_extensions" under the
       wikidPad install directory.  This directory will not be touched when
       upgrading wikidPad.  Copy the files in the "extensions" directory to
       get started.

    3. Added URL protocol handler for wikidPad so that wiki urls will open
       wikidpad. For example:
       
       wiki://C|/Program%20Files/WikidPad/WikidPadHelp/data/ChangeLog.wiki
       
       Will open up this page in a new instance of wikidPad.  This will work
       outside of wikidPad as well, from Internet Explorer for example.  The
       easiest way to create a link to another wiki from within a wiki page
       is to just drag and drop the .wiki file onto the text editor.
       
    4. Fixed some issues with the html export.  Specifically bulleted list
       problems.  Also, ignore blocks << >> weren't exported properly.

    1. If wikidPad is closed when minimized don't remember the minimized sizes.
    2. Highlighted text is only evaluated when Ctrl-E is pressed now, not Ctrl-1-6.
       This lets me implement this example InlinePythonEval#encodeSelection.

    1. Fixed a bug with todo lists under Views. Actual todo list items weren't
       displayed, only the todo list categories were.
    2. Added support passing the wiki word to open on the command line.
        wikidpad.exe wikiroot.wiki wikiword        
       You can also pass in the name of a wiki word file and wikidpad will
       open the wiki for that word and then open the word.
        wikidpad.exe path_to_wiki_word_file.wiki
       This also means that you can now double click on a wiki word file
       and wikidpad will open the wiki for the word, and then open the word.

    1. Aliases now work with words [That Arent Wiki Words].
    2. Aliases are now properly formatted in the tree control.
    3. More bug fixes.

       the beginning.
    3. Added ability to DisableCamelCaseWords.
    4. Added a menu item to disable or enable indentation guides.
    5. Added support for executing a search as part of a link.

Mar. 09, 2004

    1. Added support for WIKIDPADWords that have multiple capital letters in
       the beginning followed by lower case letters.
    2. Added support for links [That Arent Wiki Words]
    3. Moved the code triggered by Ctrl-B, Ctrl-I and Ctrl-Alt-H into
       keybindings.py.  Now if you change the regex for bold or italic you
       can also customize the code triggered by the keyboard command and the
       menu option.
    4. In some situations wikidPad might appear off screen at startup.
       Added a check for this and code to reposition wikidPad back on screen.

    1. urls that end in .gif, .jpg, or .png will be exported as \<IMG> tags
       when exporting to HTML.
    2. Tree node text is not limited to 20 characters anymore. The text used to
       be chopped at 20, and ... would be appended to the end.
    3. Words with nested underscores ARE_NOT_TREATED_AS_ITALICS.
    4. ~TurnsOffWordLinking.  ~ will cause a word to not be treated as a
       wiki word link.
    5. The HTML and XML export now wrap <<>> blocks in \<pre> tags.
    6. You can now have more than 1 link on a line.
        http://www.google.com/ http://www.yahoo.com/
    7. Added "tree_position" attribute.  Look at the bottom of this page.
       You can now change the order of the tree nodes by assigning a
       "tree_position" or a "priority" to a node.  This page has a
       tree_position of 0, so it is at the top of the tree to the left.
    8. Clicking on a todo in the "Views" node will now highlight the todo
       item in the document.
    9. Added support for script imports. This allows you to define a set
       of scripts in a GlobalScriptLibrary and then import them.
       
        [import_scripts: GlobalScriptLibrary]
       
       Type "Ctrl-4" to execute script 4 from the library.

       todos properly.  Script blocks with wiki words, and urls with wiki

       file.

    8. Added "Insert Date" command to "Editor" menu.
